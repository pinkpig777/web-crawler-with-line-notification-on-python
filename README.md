## Short Introduction
This project is a simple try on selenium and beautifulsoup, in order to get the content on the specific web(uukanshu.com).

In past day, I had troubled with not knowing when did the novel had uploaded its latest chapter, so I hoped to develope a 
simple program to automatically check whether the website had uploaded or not.

## Library or application I use
* Python
* BeautifulSoup
* Selenium
* Sys
* Re
* Requests
* Line Notification Bot

## How to Use
* Change the website to whatever books you want to read(need to be on uukanshu.com) 
* Get your own line notification token,
* Make sure the chrome driver is up to date.
